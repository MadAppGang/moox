# Every job this plugin registers is backgrounded (-b), silent and forced to
# exit 0: a run-shell whose job prints, or exits non-zero, after the client that
# issued it has gone away makes tmux 3.7b segfault in the print path and takes
# every session with it. The session id is passed as $1, single-quoted for the
# job's `sh -c` (an id is `$N`), so the scripts address THIS session's
# environment explicitly: RPASTER_SOCKET is per SSH connection, hence per
# session, and a call without -t has no current session inside a hook job.
# (The plugin directory is single-quoted too, so it may not contain a `'`.)

# Register the keybinding: prefix + <key> runs paste.sh. The pane id goes in as
# $2 because a run-shell job has no TMUX_PANE (an id is `%N`, safe to quote).

# attach; this sets RPASTER_SOCKET in the session's environment so paste.sh can
# use the socket without per-invocation probing. Slot [105] is this plugin's
# fixed index: an unindexed `set-hook -g` clears every other entry of the hook,
# and an indexed one replaces itself on reload instead of piling up.
